Returning readers (all two of them) might notice enormous change in the quality of logotypes on the blog now. The logo was made by **Ala Wojczakowska** and if you like it then make sure to check out her **[portfolio](http://wojczakowska.pl/)**, where you will find heaps of innovative and cool designs!
