Inspired how Patagonia [does business](https://msadowski.github.io/lets-learn-from-patagonia/) I decided to join 1% For The Planet, pledging to donate at least 1% of sales to environmental non-profit organizations.

## One Planet

With the recent improvements in renewable technologies, battery technologies the future looks a bit brighter but are we doing enough? I don't think so. I figured that the biggest impact I can have for the environment right now is to donate to organizations that have our planet's best interest at heart. 

The issue is also personal, as a hiker and snowboarder I hope that in the future my children will get to experience nature similar to what it is currently. Or even better experience winters similar to those I remember from my childhood.

On one hand as a fresh entrepreneur donating 1% of profits might be risky in the early stages of bussines. On the other hand what's the point of doing things if we don't try to fix the things that matter to us?

The best thing about this idea is that it's fail proof. The worst case scenario is that I need to fold my activity, which would mean that I donated some money for the issues I care about, I worked on awesome projects with great clients, learned a lot and had a blast for 6+ months. 

I'm looking forward the journey that awaits me now. You can expect a follow up post in 1 year!
