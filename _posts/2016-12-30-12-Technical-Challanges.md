As you can read in the [summary of 12 books challange]({{ site.url }}/12booksproject/12-books-project-summary) I decided to try something different this year. In this post I will try to explain what I would like this project to be. I can only hope that you are already as hyped about this project as I am!

# Trying to find a balance

The main issue I had with [12 books challange]({{ site.url }}/12booksproject/12-books-project) is that it was highly theoretical, although I still love this project and do not regret anything about it, it's time to spice things up a bit in 2017. Here is the rough idea: **For the period of 12 months complete at least 12 technical challanges**. The beuty of it is that you can decide on almost anything to be your month's challange. Some things that come to mind are:

* Learn a new programming language for a month (I'm hoping to be able to finally give Ada a shot)
* Build a robot/3d printer/plotter etc.
* Read a technical book
* Complete some MOOC or similar
* Code something (mobile app, browser extension, desktop software, game etc)
* Create a technical tutorial
* Write an article etc.

The main rule I hope I can follow is to avoid perfection, and focus on minimum viable prototype (in cases of some project types). I'm hoping to start the first *project* in January, I will make sure to post updates on this blog.

## Happy coding!
