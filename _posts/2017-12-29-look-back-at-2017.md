In lots of aspects 2017 was definitely interesting. I finally feel I settled in the Geneva area and can't wait to see what happens in 2018!

## 1PPM

Just like two years ago with [12 Books project]({{site.url}}/12booksproject/12-books-project/) last year I decided to try to create [one project a month]({{site.url}}/1ppm/12-Technical-Challanges/). Here is list of all the projects I worked on this year:


* UAV haptic control ([pt1]({{site.url}}/1ppm/uav-haptic-control-pt1/),[pt2]({{site.url}}/1ppm/uav-haptic-control-pt1/))
* [Learning ASP.NET Core]({{site.url}}/1ppm/month-of-aspnetcore/)
* Stealth Via Ferrata Project (applying some of the ASP.NET things that I learned)
* Working on a device for monitoring of Parkinson's Disease Patients for [The Port Hackathon]({{site.url}}/the-port-hackathon/)
* Learning Blockchain and applying this knowledge during Fintech Startup Weekend in Geneva in December


## Lifestyle

In 2017 I started turning into a mountain person. In January 2017 I picked up skitouring. It's the most impactful hobby I picked up in the past couple of years. Surprisingly I feel skitouring can be related to business and software development a lot! More on that soon!

Another mountain activity I picked up in the summer is climbing [Via Ferrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_ferrata). This inspired me to pursue a software project related to this activity which I later dropped in favour of Spes Spirae (the wearable for PD monitoring).

## Work

At Terabee we were up to some exciting things this year:

* We released two new products
* We Refactored and vastly improved our [Open Source packages](https://github.com/Terabee)
* We worked on various robotics concepts (safety systems for industrial robots, warehouse robots, drones, novel navigation methods, mapping etc.)

# A peak into 2018

## Resolutions

This year I'm not planning a huge yearly projects, instead I will focus on smaller goals:

* Learn a bit of Rust
* Spend way more time outdoors
* Take more risks (mountain activities being an exception)
* Post way more to this blog
* Read at least one book a month (not necessarily technical this time)

## Spes Spirae

[Spes Spirae](http://spesspirae.com/) is the working name of our Parkinson's Disease monitoring wearable device. If there is one thing I'm sure about upcoming year it's the fact that **2018 will be the year of Spes Spirae!**
