So, naturally the [12 books challange]({{ site.url }}/12booksproject/12-books-project) came to an end together with 2016 (what a year by the way!). Personally this year was quite challanging as I was involved in some crazy robotics projects, lead for a while an awesome team of engineers. Ok, ok, enough blabling about irrelevant things, let's focus on the 12 books challange!

# Failure

If we were to take the name of the challange literally then I failed hard. This year I read just **4 technical books** instead of 12 I was planning to read a year ago. 33.(3)% is not exactly a perfect score, in fact I'd claim it a ...

# Success

Just 3 programming books that I read ([C# Step by step]([12 books challange]({{ site.url }}/12booksproject/Csharp-step-by-step)), [Code Complete]([12 books challange]({{ site.url }}/12booksproject/Code-Complete)) and [C# in Depth]([12 books challange]({{ site.url }}/12booksproject/Csharp-In-Depth-Review))) completely changed my perspective on programming and I feel made me a far better developer (in just 9 months!).

Another success related to this challange is creating this blog and updating it every now and then (initially I started posting on medium.com but at some point decided to switch to github pages).

A side effect of the **12 books challange** is my list of awesome technical books, mostly about programming and robotics that currently has 37 titles but will surely grow as I find out about interesting reads, which hopefully push me to keep reading and learning.

# Lessons learned

There are many things I learned while completing this challange, in no particular order:

* It's difficult (or in my case impossible) to read (by read I mean understand the text and follow examples) 12 technical books a year while working full time, doing side projects and still maintaining a balance (I figured it's good to meet people sometimes)
* At some point it all gets easier. At the beginning I had difficulty focusing on the text but over time it got much better
* Googling answer/reading stackoverflow is helpful but it will rarely give you a thourugh understanding on the topic unless you dig deeper
* It's important to keep the balance, I don't recommend coming back from work and sitting down for 5 hours to keep going through the book (at least don't do it too often!). Remember to sometimes take some time off and relax!
* Exercise your new knowledge or take notes (I truly fell in love with vimwiki recently)
* If you decide to do this kind of challange then make sure you don't sprint, try to have marathon mindset instead

# Stats

* Books read: 4
* Books still in progress: 3
* Approximate no of pages read: 2600  (including ones in progress)
* Approximate cups of tee drunk: close to infinity

# Wrap up

In summary I'm glad I took this project. Would I do it again? No. I would do something better! That's why next year I'm starting a **12 technical projects challange**! Stay tuned for more info!
