## About me
I've always been a nerd. I graduated with a master science degree in Mechatronics Design. It wasn't exactly a rocket science... Actually it was! One of the highlights of my studies is a [sounding rocket launch campaign]({{site.url}}/Space-tehcnology-rocket-campaign/).

Currently I work at [Terabee](http://www.terabee.com) as a R&D Applications Engineer, which means every day I got to work with robots and integrating ranging sensors on them. It also means I still get to play with drones and work a lot with ROS (Robot Operating System).

Between 2014 and 2016 I was working at [SkyCircuits](http://www.skycircuits.com) where I was writing ground control station software for UAV autopilots and even led an autopilot integration project on 50kg+ helicopter platform (by the way, it was super cool!).

## What are you going to find on this blog
Short answer: everything.
A bit longer answer: I'm a very keen learner. I study lots of different topics at different times. When I find something interesting I'm likely to share it on this blog. Stay tuned for more information!
