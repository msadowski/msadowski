# About me
I'm an independent contractor in the fields of Robotics, Drones and Software Development based in Geneva, Switzerland. If you would like to know more and potentially work with me, please feel free to get in [touch](mailto:{{{site.owner.email}}).

I graduated with a master science degree in Mechatronics Design. It wasn't exactly a rocket science... Actually it was! One of the highlights of my studies is a [sounding rocket launch campaign]({{site.url}}/Space-technology-rocket-campaign/).

From November 2016 until May 2018 I've worked with Terabee as an R&D Application Engineer. I mostly helped integrating ToF distance sensors on UAV platforms for performing altitude hold, obstacle and collision avoidance. I also helped develop custom mobile robotics solutions using Robot Operating System (ROS).

Between 2014 and 2016 I was working at [SkyCircuits](http://www.skycircuits.com) where I was writing ground control station software for UAV autopilots and even led an autopilot integration project on 50kg+ helicopter platform (by the way, it was super cool!).

# Hire me!

## Drones
I like drones! I started working with drones in 2012 and have been working with them since. I can offer my expertise in system design and integration, high level programming, sensor integration. I have experience working with proprietary and open source autopilots (e.g. Pixhawk).

## Robotics
I speak ROS (Robot Operating System). I understand its strengths and weaknesses. I have a track of leading multiple robotics projects for various platforms such as multirotors, helicopters, mobile and industrial robots.

## Software Development
I'm an experience C# developer (Windows Forms, WPF, UWP). I have years of experience of working on desktop applications such as drone flight management software, GUIs for software for autopilot interfacing, Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera control software. If you are looking for an extra developer for your team then feel free to contact me!
